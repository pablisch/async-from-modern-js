# Asynchronous JS from Traversy Modern JS course

All the files in this repo are working files from the Asynchronous JavaScript section of the [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Revamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/37192650#overview) course by Brad Traversy.

All the files are grouped by name, i.e. function.html, function.js, function.css are all files belonging to a single section of the module.

These were completed to reinforce the concepts and practice of asynchronous JavaScript while learning on the Makers Academy course.

## Running the files

To run the files, clone the repo and open the index.html file in your browser. You can then open the console to see the output of the JavaScript.
Example:

```bash
open function.html
```
